# Pong
Play Pong against a friend or against the computer!

This is Assignment 0 of Harvard's edX GD50 class. The instructor, Colton Ogden,
created the code for making the two-player Pong game. I updated it by creating
a single-player mode in which the user can play against the CPU on easy,
medium, or hard difficulty.

List of Updates:
1. Created easy, medium, hard CPU
2. Added some sound effects
3. Added more global variables to reduce magic numbers
